Given a set of distinct integers, S, return all possible subsets.

Note: 1) Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order. 2) The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

For example, given S = [1,2,3], the method returns:
[
  [3],
  [1],
  [2],
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3],
  [2,3],
  [1,2],
  []
]


Thoughts
Given a set S of n distinct integers, there is a relation between Sn and Sn-1. 
The subset of Sn-1 is the union of {subset of Sn-1} and {each element in Sn-1 + one more element}. 
Therefore, a Java solution can be quickly formalized.
